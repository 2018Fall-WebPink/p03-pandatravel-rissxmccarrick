                <figcaption>Once known as <blockquote>Jack the Ripper</blockquote>, this Spitalfields pub can't get away from its gory history. Some accounts of the Ripper story link two of his victims, Annie Chapman and Mary Jane Kelly, to the pub.  The Ten Bells is haunted by the ghost of the mutilated Annie Chapman. If that's not spooky enough, the pub also has a long recorded history of poltergeist activity.</figcaption>
